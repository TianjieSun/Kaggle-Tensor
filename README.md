# Kaggle-Tensor
This repo includes a kaggle project
After learning ECE4950 Machine Learning course, I tried to put all the knowledge into practice. The in-class kaggle challenge project is a crap for me. This summer, I join a real-life kaggle challenge to improve my machine learning skills plus introduce tensorflow tool to refine the project.
# Tesnorflow
Tensorflow is a good tool to execute machine learning via calculation graph which is a flow graph.
